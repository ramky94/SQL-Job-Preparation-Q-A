1. Table DEPT:
---------------------------------
DEPTNO(PK) DNAME
10 AC
---------------------------------

2.Table EMP:
---------------------------------
EMPNO ENAME DEPTNO(FK)
101 ROCK 10
102 JACK 10
103 MARK 10
104 JERRY 10
---------------------------------
Q:What is the difference between the parent and child tables, and why?

A1:DEPT table which will be the parent table of the EMP table.
create table dept(  
  deptno     number(2,0),  
  dname      varchar2(14),  
  loc        varchar2(13),  
  constraint pk_dept primary key (deptno)).

A2.EMP table which has a foreign key reference to the DEPT table. 
The foreign key will require that the DEPTNO in the EMP table exist in the DEPTNO column in the DEPT table.
create table emp(  
  empno    number(4,0),  
  ename    varchar2(10),  
  job      varchar2(9),  
  mgr      number(4,0),  
  hiredate date,  
  sal      number(7,2),  
  comm     number(7,2),  
  deptno   number(2,0),  
  constraint pk_emp primary key (empno),  
  constraint fk_deptno foreign key (deptno) references dept (deptno))

Q2.What are the 4 components of a database system?
The four major components of a database are hardware, software, data, procedure, and database access language.

Q3. What is the distinction between SQL and SQL plus?
SQL is the query language used for communication with Oracle server to access and modify the data. 
SQL* Plus is a command line tool with which you can send SQL queries to the server

SQL is a language which is invented by IBM.
SQL * Plus is a tool to use SQL language for a database from Oracle corporation.

SQL can be simply used to ask queries, i.e. it involves DML, DDL and DCL.
SQL * Plus is command line tool which doesn’t involve DML, DDL and DCL.

In SQL, there is no continuation character..
Whereas, in SQL * Plus there is a continuation character.

Keywords cannot be abbreviated in SQL.
But keywords can be abbreviated in SQL*Plus.

Q4. What is the definition of normalization?
Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion,Update and Deletion Anomalies. ... 
The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically

Q5. Give examples of 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF.
1NF:relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
Example: Suppose a company wants to store the names and contact details of its employees. It creates a table that looks like this:
--------------------------------------------------
emp_id	emp_name	emp_address	emp_mobile
101	Herschel	New Delhi	8912312390

2NF:relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
Example:school wants to store the data of teachers and the subjects they teach. They create a table that looks like this: Since a teacher can teach more than one subjects, the table can have multiple rows for a same teacher.
-----------------------------------
teacher_id	subject	teacher_age
111	Maths	38

3NF:relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.
Example:company wants to store the complete address of each employee, they create a table named employee_details that looks like this:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
emp_id	emp_name	emp_zip	emp_state	emp_city	emp_district
1001	John	282005	UP	Agra	Dayal Bagh

BCNF:It is an advance version of 3NF that’s why it is also referred as 3.5NF. BCNF is stricter than 3NF.
A table complies with BCNF if it is in 3NF and for every functional dependency X->Y, X should be the super key of the table.

Example:There is a company wherein employees work in more than one department. They store the data like this:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
emp_id	emp_nationality	emp_dept	dept_type	dept_no_of_emp
1001	Austrian	Production and planning	D001	200
